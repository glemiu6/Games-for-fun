## Summary

I made some games using python to help me learn some aspects like `while` loops, using the `random` library.
The games are :

- [Guess the number](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/guessnum.py) 
- [Hangman](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/hangman.py)
- [Pig](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/pig%20game.py)
- [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/rock%20paper.py)

## Description about the game

### - [Guess the number](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/guessnum.py)  

Main objective: Guessing the number 

---

For starters , we import the `random` library so the computer can generate a random number between 1 and `n`.  
Then we start guessing.  
If the number is higher than the one the computer generated it shows : `To big, the number is smaller`.  
If it's too small, we get this message : `To small , the number is bigger`.  
If we guess the number correctly , the message will be this : `You guessed correctly`.

### - [Hangman](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/hangman.py)

Main objective: Guessing the word in 7 tries.
