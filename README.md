## Summary

I made some games using python to help me learn some aspects like `while` loops, using the `random` library.
The games are :

- [Guess the number](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/guessnum.py) 
- [Hangman](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/hangman.py)
- [Pig](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/pig%20game.py)
- [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/glemiu6/Games-for-fun/blob/master/Games/rock%20paper.py)
